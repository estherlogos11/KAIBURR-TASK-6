# KAIBURR TASK 6
# Data Science example.
Perform a Text Classification on consumer complaint dataset
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) into following categories.
0 Credit reporting, repair, or
other
1 Debt collection
2 Consumer Loan
3 Mortgage

1. **Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**
   - Understand your dataset: Analyze the structure, size, and basic statistics of your dataset.
   - Visualize data: Create plots and visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of classes and features.
   - Handle missing data: Determine if there are missing values and decide how to handle them (impute or remove).
   - Feature Engineering: Create new features that might help improve model performance. For text data, this could include extracting word counts, TF-IDF scores, or word embeddings.

2. **Text Pre-Processing:**
   - Tokenization: Break down text into individual words or tokens.
   - Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
   - Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., "and," "the," "is") that may not contribute much to classification.
   - Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the text.
   - Handling special characters: Remove or replace special characters, punctuation, and symbols.
   - Text Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical format, such as TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings.
   

3. **Selection of Multi-Classification Model:**
   - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for multi-class classification. Common choices include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machines
     - Naive Bayes
     - Neural Networks (e.g., deep learning models)
     - 

4. **Comparison of Model Performance:**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 70-30 or 80-20 split).
   - Train multiple models with different algorithms or hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
   - Use cross-validation techniques to assess model generalization.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance (e.g., grid search or random search).
   - Perform a final evaluation on a separate test dataset to estimate how the model will perform in the real world.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Once you have a well-performing model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
   - Preprocess the new text data in the same way as the training data.
   - Use the trained model to predict the class labels for the new data.
